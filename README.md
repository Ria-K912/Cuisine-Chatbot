<h2>Interactive Cuisine Chatbot with NLP</h2>
<p>This project develops an interactive chatbot utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) to engage users in conversations about cuisines. By processing user inputs, the chatbot can provide responses, offer suggestions, and guide users through the vast world of culinary arts. The backbone of the chatbot is built on Python libraries like NLTK and Sklearn, emphasizing text processing, understanding, and response generation.</p>

<b>Libraries used:</b>
<ul>
  <li><code>nltk</code> for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and lemmatization.</li>
  <li><code>numpy</code> for numerical and array operations essential for text processing.</li>
  <li><code>bs4 (BeautifulSoup)</code> for scraping web data that can be used to enhance the chatbot's knowledge base.</li>
  <li><code>requests</code> for making HTTP requests to web pages, allowing the chatbot to fetch and process live data.</li>
  <li><code>re (regular expressions)</code> for advanced string manipulations and pattern matching.</li>
  <li><code>sklearn</code> for advanced NLP techniques, including TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity for response selection.</li>
</ul>

<b>Core Functionalities:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Greeting Recognition: Employs simple pattern matching to greet users based on their initial inputs.</li>
  <li>Text Processing: Utilizes tokenization, lemmatization, and punctuation removal to process user queries.</li>
  <li>Response Generation: Applies TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity measures to generate relevant responses from the chatbot's knowledge base.</li>
  <li>Conversation Management: Maintains a dynamic conversation flow, handling common courtesies and the ability to quit the conversation gracefully.</li>
</ul>

<b>Implementation Highlights:</b>
<ul>
  <li>The chatbot initializes by greeting the user and inviting questions about cuisines.</li>
  <li>Uses a mix of pre-defined greetings and dynamically generated responses based on the user's queries.</li>
  <li>Incorporates error handling to manage unknown queries, ensuring the chatbot can gracefully handle any input.</li>
  <li>Supports a 'quit' functionality to end the conversation, emphasizing user control over the chat session.</li>
</ul>

<b>Conclusion:</b>
<p>The cuisine chatbot project showcases the integration of NLP techniques to create a user-friendly and informative chat interface. Through its ability to understand and process human language, it offers an engaging platform for users to explore and learn about various cuisines, demonstrating the power of AI and machine learning in enhancing digital experiences.</p>
